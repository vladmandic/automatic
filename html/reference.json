Through its novel design, we achieve a 42x spatial compression. Würstchen employs a two-stage compression, what we call Stage A and Stage B. Stage A is a VQGAN, and Stage B is a Diffusion Autoencoder (more details can be found in the paper). A third model, Stage C, is learned in that highly compressed latent space.
