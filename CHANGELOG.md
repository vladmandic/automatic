# Change Log for SD.Next

## Update for 2024-11-27

### New models and integrations

- [Flux Tools](https://blackforestlabs.ai/flux-1-tools/)  
  **Redux** is actually a tool, **Fill** is inpaint/outpaint optimized version of *Flux-dev*  
  **Canny** & **Depth** are optimized versions of *Flux-dev* for their respective tasks: they are *not* ControlNets that work on top of a model  
  to use, go to image or control interface and select *Flux Tools* in scripts  
  all models are auto-downloaded on first use  
  *note*: All models are [gated](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/wiki/Gated) and require acceptance of terms and conditions via web page  
  *recommended*: Enable on-the-fly [quantization](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/wiki/Quantization) or [compression](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/wiki/NNCF-Compression) to reduce resource usage  
  *todo*: support for Canny/Depth LoRAs  
  - [Redux](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-Redux-dev): ~0.1GB  
    works together with existing model and basically uses input image to analyze it and use that instead of prompt  
    *recommended*: low denoise strength levels result in more variety  
  - [Fill](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-Fill-dev): ~23.8GB, replaces currently loaded model  
    *note*: can be used in inpaint/outpaint mode only  
  - [Canny](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-Canny-dev): ~23.8GB, replaces currently loaded model  
    *recommended*: guidance scale 30  
  - [Depth](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-Depth-dev): ~23.8GB, replaces currently loaded model  
    *recommended*: guidance scale 10  
- [Style Aligned Image Generation](https://style-aligned-gen.github.io/)  
  enable in scripts, compatible with sd-xl  
  enter multiple prompts in prompt field separated by new line  
  style-aligned applies selected attention layers uniformly to all images to achive consistency  
  can be used with or without input image in which case first prompt is used to establish baseline  
  *note:* all prompts are processes as a single batch, so vram is limiting factor

### UI and workflow improvements

- **Model loader** improvements:  
  - detect model components on model load fail  
  - Flux, SD35: force unload model  
  - Flux: apply `bnb` quant when loading *unet/transformer*  
  - Flux: all-in-one safetensors  
    example: <https://civitai.com/models/646328?modelVersionId=1040235>  
  - Flux: do not recast quants  
- **UI**:  
  - improved stats on generate completion  
  - improved live preview display and performance  
  - improved accordion behavior  
  - auto-size networks height for sidebar  
  - control: hide preview column by default
  - control: optionn to hide input column
  - control: add stats
  - browser->server logging framework  
- **Sampler** improvements  
  - update DPM FlowMatch samplers  

### Fixes  

- update `diffusers`  
- fix README links  
- fix sdxl controlnet single-file loader  
- relax settings validator  
- improve js progress calls resiliency  
- fix text-to-video pipeline

- allow xyz-grid with multi-axis s&r  
- fix xyz-grid with lora  
- fix api script callbacks

### Details for 2024-10-29

- model selector:
  - change-in-behavior
  - when typing, it will auto-load model as soon as exactly one match is found
  - allows entering model that are not on the list which triggers huggingface search  
    e.g. `stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0`  
    partial search hits are displayed in the log  
    if exact model is found, it will be auto-downloaded and loaded  
  - allows entering civitai direct download link which triggers model download  
    e.g. `https://civitai.com/api/download/models/72396?type=Model&format=SafeTensor&size=full&fp=fp16`  
  - auto-search-and-download can be disabled in settings -> models -> auto-download

## Update for 2024-10-23

### Highlights for 2024-10-23

A month later and with nearly 300 commits, here is the latest [SD.Next](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic) update!  

#### Workflow highlights for 2024-10-23

- **Reprocess**: New workflow options that allow you to generate at lower quality and then  
  reprocess at higher quality for select images only or generate without hires/refine and then reprocess with hires/refine  
  and you can pick any previous latent from auto-captured history!  
- **Detailer** Fully built-in detailer workflow with support for all standard models  
- Built-in **model analyzer**  
  See all details of your currently loaded model, including components, parameter count, layer count, etc.  
- **Extract LoRA**: load any LoRA(s) and play with generate as usual  
  and once you like the results simply extract combined LoRA for future use!  

#### New models for 2024-10-23

- New fine-tuned [CLiP-ViT-L]((https://huggingface.co/zer0int/CLIP-GmP-ViT-L-14)) 1st stage **text-encoders** used by most models (SD15/SDXL/SD3/Flux/etc.) brings additional details to your images  
- New models:  
  [Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-3.5-large)  
  [OmniGen](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11340)  
  [CogView 3 Plus](https://huggingface.co/THUDM/CogView3-Plus-3B)  
  [Meissonic](https://github.com/viiika/Meissonic)  
- Additional integration:  
  [Ctrl+X](https://github.com/genforce/ctrl-x) which allows for control of **structure and appearance** without the need for extra models,  
  [APG: Adaptive Projected Guidance](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02416) for optimal **guidance** control,  
  [LinFusion](https://github.com/Huage001/LinFusion) for on-the-fly **distillation** of any sd15/sdxl model  

#### What else for 2024-10-23

- Tons of work on **dynamic quantization** that can be applied *on-the-fly* during model load to any model type (*you do not need to use pre-quantized models*)  
  Supported quantization engines include `BitsAndBytes`, `TorchAO`, `Optimum.quanto`, `NNCF` compression, and more...  
- Auto-detection of best available **device/dtype** settings for your platform and GPU reduces neeed for manual configuration  
  *Note*: This is a breaking change to default settings and its recommended to check your preferred settings after upgrade  
- Full rewrite of **sampler options**, not far more streamlined with tons of new options to tweak scheduler behavior  
- Improved **LoRA** detection and handling for all supported models  
- Several of [Flux.1](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev) optimizations and new quantization types  

Oh, and we've compiled a full table with list of top-30 (*how many have you tried?*) popular text-to-image generative models,  
their respective parameters and architecture overview: [Models Overview](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/wiki/Models)  

And there are also other goodies like multiple *XYZ grid* improvements, additional *Flux ControlNets*, additional *Interrogate models*, better *LoRA tags* support, and more...  
[README](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/blob/master/README.md) | [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) | [WiKi](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/wiki) | [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/sd-next-federal-batch-inspectors-1101998836328697867)

### Details for 2024-10-23

- **reprocess**
  - new top-level button: reprocess latent from your history of generated image(s)  
  - generate using full-quality:off and then reprocess using *full quality decode*  
  - generate without hires/refine and then *reprocess with hires/refine*  
    *note*: you can change hires/refine settings and run-reprocess again!  
  - reprocess using *detailer*  

- **history**
  - by default, **reprocess** will pick last latent, but you can select any latent from history!  
  - history is under *networks -> history*  
    each history item includes info on operations that were used, timestamp and metadata  
  - any latent operation during workflow automatically adds one or more items to history  
    e.g. generate base + upscale + hires + detailer  
  - history size: *settings -> execution -> latent history size*  
    memory usage is ~130kb of ram for 1mp image  
  - *note* list of latents in history is not auto-refreshed, use refresh button  

- **model analyzer**  
  - see all details of your currently loaded model, including components, parameter count, layer count, etc.  
  - in models -> current -> analyze  

- **text encoder**:  
  - allow loading different custom text encoders: *clip-vit-l, clip-vit-g, t5*  
    will automatically find appropriate encoder in the loaded model and replace it with loaded text encoder  
    download text encoders into folder set in settings -> system paths -> text encoders  
    default `models/Text-encoder` folder is used if no custom path is set  
    finetuned *clip-vit-l* models: [Detailed, Smooth](https://huggingface.co/zer0int/CLIP-GmP-ViT-L-14), [LongCLIP](https://huggingface.co/zer0int/LongCLIP-GmP-ViT-L-14)  
    reference *clip-vit-l* and *clip-vit-g* models: [OpenCLIP-Laion2b](https://huggingface.co/collections/laion/openclip-laion-2b-64fcade42d20ced4e9389b30)  
    *note* sd/sdxl contain heavily distilled versions of reference models, so switching to reference model produces vastly different results  
  - xyz grid support for text encoder  
  - full prompt parser now correctly works with different prompts in batch  

- **detailer**:  
  - replaced *face-hires* with *detailer* which can run any number of standard detailing models  
  - includes *face/hand/person/eyes* predefined detailer models plus support for manually downloaded models  
    set path in *settings -> system paths -> yolo*  
  - select one or more models in detailer menu and thats it!  
  - to avoid duplication of ui elements, detailer will use following values from **refiner**:  
    *sampler, steps, prompts*  
  - when using multiple detailers and prompt is *multi-line*, each line is applied to corresponding detailer  
  - adjustable settings:  
    *strength, max detected objects, edge padding, edge blur, min detection confidence, max detection overlap, min and max size of detected object*  
  - image metadata includes info on used detailer models  
  - *note* detailer defaults are not save in ui settings, they are saved in server settings  
    to apply your defaults, set ui values and apply via *system -> settings -> apply settings*  
  - if using models trained on multiple classes, you can specify which classes you want to detail  
    e.g. original yolo detection model is trained on coco dataset with 80 predefined classes  
    if you leave field blank, it will use any class found in the model  
    you can see classes defined in the model while model itself is loaded for the first time  

- **extract lora**: extract combined lora from current memory state, thanks @AI-Casanova  
  load any LoRA(s) and play with generate as usual and once you like the results simply extract combined LoRA for future use!  
  in *models -> extract lora*  

- **sampler options**: full rewrite  

  *sampler notes*:  
  - pick a sampler and then pick values, all values have "default" as a choice to make it simpler  
  - a lot of options are new, some are old but moved around  
    e.g. karras checkbox is replaced with a choice of different sigma methods  
  - not every combination of settings is valid  
  - some settings are specific to model types  
    e.g. sd15/sdxl typically use epsilon prediction  
  - quite a few well-known schedulers are just variations of settings, for example:  
    - *sampler sgm* is sampler with trailing spacing and sample prediction type  
    - *dpm 2m* or *3m* are *dpm 1s* with orders of 2 or 3  
    - *dpm 2m sde* is *dpm 2m* with *sde* as solver  
    - *sampler simple* is sampler with trailing spacing and linear beta schedule
  - xyz grid support for sampler options  
  - metadata updates for sampler options  
  - modernui updates for sampler options  
  - *note* sampler options defaults are not save in ui settings, they are saved in server settings  
    to apply your defaults, set ui values and apply via *system -> settings -> apply settings*  

  *sampler options*:  
  - sigma method: *karas, beta, exponential*  
  - timesteps spacing: *linspace, leading, trailing*  
  - beta schedule: *linear, scaled, cosine*  
  - prediction type: *epsilon, sample, v-prediction*  
  - timesteps presents: *none, ays-sd15, ays-sdxl*  
  - timesteps override: <custom>  
  - sampler order: *0=default, 1-5*  
  - options: *dynamic, low order, rescale*  

- [Ctrl+X](https://github.com/genforce/ctrl-x):
  - control **structure** (*similar to controlnet*) and **appearance** (*similar to ipadapter*)  
    without the need for extra models, all via code feed-forwards!
  - can run in structure-only or appearance-only or both modes
  - when providing structure and appearance input images, its best to provide a short prompts describing them  
  - structure image can be *almost anything*: *actual photo, openpose-style stick man, 3d render, sketch, depth-map, etc.*  
    just describe what it is in a structure prompt so it can be de-structured and correctly applied  
  - supports sdxl in both txt2img and img2img, simply select from scripts

- [APG: Adaptive Projected Guidance](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02416)
  - latest algo to provide better guidance for image generation, can be used instead of existing guidance rescale and/or PAG  
  - in addtion to stronger guidance and reduction of burn at high guidance values, it can also increase image details  
  - compatible with *sd15/sdxl/sc*  
  - select in scripts -> apg  
  - for low    cfg scale, use positive momentum: e.g. cfg=2 => momentum=0.6
  - for normal cfg scale, use negative momentum: e.g. cfg=6 => momentum=-0.3
  - for high   cfg scale, use neutral  momentum: e.g. cfg=10 => momentum=0.0

- [LinFusion](https://github.com/Huage001/LinFusion)  
  - apply liner distillation to during load to any sd15/sdxl model

- [Flux](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev)  
  - see [wiki](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/wiki/FLUX#quantization) for details on `gguf`  
  - support for `gguf` binary format for loading unet/transformer component  
  - support for `gguf` binary format for loading t5/text-encoder component: requires transformers pr  
  - additional controlnets: [JasperAI](https://huggingface.co/collections/jasperai/flux1-dev-controlnets-66f27f9459d760dcafa32e08) **Depth**, **Upscaler**, **Surface**, thanks @EnragedAntelope  
  - additional controlnets: [XLabs-AI](https://huggingface.co/XLabs-AI/flux-controlnet-hed-diffusers) **Canny**, **Depth**, **HED**  
  - mark specific unet as unavailable if load failed  
  - fix diffusers local model name parsing  
  - full prompt parser will auto-select `xhinker` for flux models  
  - controlnet support for img2img and inpaint (in addition to previous txt2img controlnet)  
  - allow separate vae load  
  - support for both kohya and onetrainer loras in native load mode for fp16/nf4/fp4, thanks @AI-Casanova  
  - support for differential diffusion  
  - added native load mode for qint8/qint4 models
  - avoid unet load if unchanged  

- [OmniGen](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11340)  
  - Radical new model with pure LLM architecture based on Phi-3  
  - Select from *networks -> models -> reference*  
  - Can be used for text-to-image and image-to-image  
  - Image-to-image is *very* different, you need to specify in prompt what do you want to do  
    and add `|image|` placeholder where input image is used!  
    examples: `in |image| remove glasses from face`, `using depth map from |image|, create new image of a cute robot`  
  - Params used: prompt, steps, guidance scale for prompt guidance, refine guidance scale for image guidance  
    Recommended: guidance=3.0, refine-guidance=1.6  

- [Stable Diffusion 3.5 Large](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-3.5-large)  
  - New/improved variant of Stable Diffusion 3  
  - Select from *networks -> models -> reference*  
  - Available in standard and turbo variations  
  - *Note*: Access to to both variations of SD3.5 model is gated, you must accept the conditions and use HF login  

- [CogView 3 Plus](https://huggingface.co/THUDM/CogView3-Plus-3B)
  - Select from *networks -> models -> reference*  
  - resolution width and height can be from 512px to 2048px and must be divisible by 32  
  - precision: bf16 or fp32  
    fp16 is not supported due to internal model overflows  

- [Meissonic](https://github.com/viiika/Meissonic)  
  - Select from *networks -> models -> reference*  
  - Experimental as upstream implemenation code is unstable
  - Must set scheduler:default, generator:unset

- [SageAttention](https://github.com/thu-ml/SageAttention)  
  - new 8-bit attention implementation on top of SDP that can provide acceleration for some models, thanks @Disty0  
  - enable in *settings -> compute settings -> sdp options -> sage attention*
  - compatible with DiT-based models: e.g. *Flux.1, AuraFlow, CogVideoX*  
  - not compatible with UNet-based models, e.g. *SD15, SDXL*  

- **gpu**
  - previously `cuda_dtype` in settings defaulted to `fp16` if available  
  - now `cuda_type` defaults to **Auto** which executes `bf16` and `fp16` tests on startup and selects best available dtype  
    if you have specific requirements, you can still set to fp32/fp16/bf16 as desired  
    if you have gpu that incorrectly identifies bf16 or fp16 availablity, let us know so we can improve the auto-detection  
  - support for torch **expandable segments**  
    enable in *settings -> compute -> torch expandable segments*  
    can provide significant memory savings for some models  
    not enabled by default as its only supported on latest versions of torch and some gpus  

- **xyz grid** full refactor  
  - multi-mode: *selectable-script* and *alwayson-script*  
  - allow usage combined with other scripts  
  - allow **unet** selection  
  - allow passing **model args** directly:  
    allowed params will be checked against models call signature  
    example: `width=768; height=512, width=512; height=768`  
  - allow passing **processing args** directly:  
    params are set directly on main processing object and can be known or new params  
    example: `steps=10, steps=20; test=unknown`  
  - enable working with different resolutions  
    now you can adjust width/height in the grid just as any other param  
  - renamed options to include section name and adjusted cost of each option  
  - added additional metadata  

- **interrogate**  
  - add additional blip models: *blip-base, blip-large, blip-t5-xl, blip-t5-xxl, opt-2.7b, opt-6.7b*  
  - change default params for better memory utilization  
  - lock commits for miaoshouAI-promptgen  
  - add optional advanced params  
  - update logging  

- **lora** auto-apply tags to prompt  
  - controlled via *settings -> networks -> lora_apply_tags*  
    *0:disable, -1:all-tags, n:top-n-tags*  
  - uses tags from both model embedded data and civitai downloaded data  
  - if lora contains no tags, lora name itself will be used as a tag  
  - if prompt contains `_tags_` it will be used as placeholder for replacement, otherwise tags will be appended  
  - used tags are also logged and registered in image metadata  
  - loras are no longer filtered per detected type vs loaded model type as its unreliable  
  - loras display in networks now shows possible version in top-left corner  
  - correct using of `extra_networks_default_multiplier` if not scale is specified  
  - improve lora base model detection  
  - improve lora error handling and logging  
  - setting `lora_load_gpu` to load LoRA directly to GPU  
    *default*: true unless lovwram  

- **quantization**  
  - new top level settings group as we have quite a few quantization options now!  
    configure in *settings -> quantization*  
  - in addition to existing `optimum.quanto` and `nncf`, we now have `bitsandbytes` and `torchao`  
  - **bitsandbytes**: fp8, fp4, nf4  
    - quantization can be applied on-the-fly during model load  
    - currently supports `transformers` and `t5` in **sd3** and **flux**  
  - **torchao**: int8, int4, fp8, fp4, fpx  
    - configure in settings -> quantization  
    - can be applied to any model on-the-fly during load  

- **huggingface**:  
  - force logout/login on token change  
  - unified handling of cache folder: set via `HF_HUB` or `HF_HUB_CACHE` or via settings -> system paths  

- **cogvideox**:  
  - add support for *image2video* (in addition to previous *text2video* and *video2video*)  
  - *note*: *image2video* requires separate 5b model variant  

- **torch**  
  - due to numerous issues with torch 2.5.0 which was just released as stable, we are sticking with 2.4.1 for now  

- **backend=original** is now marked as in maintenance-only mode

- Full **ControlNet** support, better **LoRA** support, full **prompt attention** implementation  
- Faster execution, more flexible loading, additional quantization options, and more...  
- Added **image-to-image**, **inpaint**, **outpaint**, **hires** modes  
- Added workflow where FLUX can be used as **refiner** for other models  
- Since both *Optimum-Quanto* and *BitsAndBytes* libraries are limited in their platform support matrix,  
  try enabling **NNCF** for quantization/compression on-the-fly!

### Details for 2024-09-13

**Major refactor of FLUX.1 support:**
- allow configuration of individual FLUX.1 model components: *transformer, text-encoder, vae*  
  model load will load selected components first and then initialize model using pre-loaded components  
  components that were not pre-loaded will be downloaded and initialized as needed  
  as usual, components can also be loaded after initial model load  
  *note*: use of transformer/unet is recommended as those are flux.1 finetunes  
  *note*: manually selecting vae and text-encoder is not recommended  
  *note*: mix-and-match of different quantizations for different components can lead to unexpected errors  
  - transformer/unet is list of manually downloaded safetensors  
  - vae is list of manually downloaded safetensors  
  - text-encoder is list of predefined and manually downloaded text-encoders  
- **controlnet** support:
  support for **InstantX/Shakker-Labs** models including [Union-Pro](InstantX/FLUX.1-dev-Controlnet-Union)  
  note that flux controlnet models are large, up to 6.6GB on top of already large base model!  
  as such, you may need to use offloading:sequential which is not as fast, but uses far less memory  
  when using union model, you must also select control mode in the control unit  
  flux does not yet support *img2img* so to use controlnet, you need to set contronet input via control unit override  
- model support loading **all-in-one** safetensors  
  not recommended due to massive duplication of components, but added due to popular demand  
  each such model is 20-32GB in size vs ~11GB for typical unet fine-tune  
- improve logging, warn when attempting to load unet as base model  
- **refiner** support  
  FLUX.1 can be used as refiner for other models such as sd/sdxl  
  simply load sd/sdxl model as base and flux model as refiner and use as usual refiner workflow  
- **img2img**, **inpaint** and **outpaint** support  
  *note* flux may require higher denoising strength than typical sd/sdxl models  
  *note*: img2img is not yet supported with controlnet  
- transformer/unet support *fp8/fp4* quantization  
  this brings supported quants to: *nf4/fp8/fp4/qint8/qint4*
- vae support *fp16*  
- **lora** support additional training tools  
- **face-hires** support  
- support **fuse-qkv** projections  
  can speed up generate  
  enable via *settings -> compute -> fused projections*  

**Other improvements & Fixes:**
- [CogVideoX](https://huggingface.co/THUDM/CogVideoX-5b)  
  - support for both **2B** and **5B** variations  
  - support for both **text2video** and **video2video** modes
  - simply select in *scripts -> cogvideox*  
  - as with any video modules, includes additional frame interpolation using RIFE  
  - if init video is used, it will be automatically resized and interpolated to desired number of frames  
- **AnimateDiff**:  
  - **prompt travel**  
     create video which travels between different prompts at different steps!  
     example prompt:
      > 0: dog  
      > 5: cat  
      > 10: bird  
  - support for **v3** model (finally)  
  - support for **LCM** model  
  - support for **free-noise** rolling context window  
    allow for creation of much longer videos, automatically enabled if frames > 16  
- **Context-aware** image resize, thanks @AI-Casanova!  
  based on [seam-carving](https://github.com/li-plus/seam-carving)  
  allows for *img2img/inpaint* even at massively different aspect ratios without distortions!  
  simply select as resize method when using *img2img* or *control* tabs  
- **HDR** high-dynamic-range image create for SD and SDXL  
  create hdr images from in multiple exposures by latent-space modifications during generation  
  use via *scripts -> hdr*  
  option *save hdr images* creates images in standard 8bit/channel (hdr-effect) *and* 16bit/channel (full-hdr) PNG format  
  ui result is always 8bit/channel hdr-effect image plus grid of original images used to create hdr  
  grid image can be disabled via settings -> user interface -> show grid  
  actual full-hdr image is not displayed in ui, only optionally saved to disk  
- new scheduler: [DC Solver](https://github.com/wl-zhao/DC-Solver)  
- **color grading** apply professional color grading to your images  
  using industry-standard *.cube* LUTs!
  enable via *scripts -> color-grading*  
- **hires** workflow now allows for full resize options  
  not just limited width/height/scale  
- **xyz grid** is now availabe as both local and global script!
- **prompt enhance**: improve quality and/or verbosity of your prompts  
  simply select in *scripts -> prompt enhance*
  uses [gokaygokay/Flux-Prompt-Enhance](https://huggingface.co/gokaygokay/Flux-Prompt-Enhance) model  
- **decode**
  - auto-set upcast if first decode fails  
  - restore dtype on upcast  
- **taesd** configurable number of layers  
  can be used to speed-up taesd decoding by reducing number of ops  
  e.g. if generating 1024px image, reducing layers by 1 will result in preview being 512px  
  set via *settings -> live preview -> taesd decode layers*  
- **xhinker** prompt parser handle offloaded models  
- **control** better handle offloading  
- **upscale** will use resize-to if set to non-zero values over resize-by  
  applies to any upscale options, including refine workflow  
- **networks** add option to choose if mouse-over on network should attempt to fetch additional info  
  option:`extra_networks_fetch` enable/disable in *settings -> networks*  
- speed up some garbage collection ops  
- sampler settings add **dynamic shift**  
  used by flow-matching samplers to adjust between structure and details  
- sampler settings force base shift  
  improves quality of the flow-matching samplers  
- **t5** support manually downloaded models  
  applies to all models that use t5 transformer  
- **modern-ui** add override field  
- full **lint** updates  
- use `diffusers` from main branch, no longer tied to release  
- improve diffusers/transformers/huggingface_hub progress reporting  
- use unique identifiers for all ui components  
- **visual query** (a.ka vqa or vlm) added support for several models
  - [MiaoshouAI PromptGen 1.5 Base](https://huggingface.co/MiaoshouAI/Florence-2-base-PromptGen-v1.5)
  - [MiaoshouAI PromptGen 1.5 Large](https://huggingface.co/MiaoshouAI/Florence-2-large-PromptGen-v1.5)

## Update for 2024-08-31

### Highlights for 2024-08-31

Summer break is over and we are back with a massive update!  

Support for all of the new models:  
- [Black Forest Labs FLUX.1](https://blackforestlabs.ai/announcing-black-forest-labs/)  
- [AuraFlow 0.3](https://huggingface.co/fal/AuraFlow)  
- [AlphaVLLM Lumina-Next-SFT](https://huggingface.co/Alpha-VLLM/Lumina-Next-SFT-diffusers)  
- [Kwai Kolors](https://huggingface.co/Kwai-Kolors/Kolors)  
- [HunyuanDiT 1.2](https://huggingface.co/Tencent-Hunyuan/HunyuanDiT-v1.2-Diffusers)  

What else? Just a bit... ;)  

New **fast-install** mode, new **Optimum Quanto** and **BitsAndBytes** based quantization modes, new **balanced offload** mode that dynamically offloads GPU<->CPU as needed, and more...  
And from previous service-pack: new **ControlNet-Union** *all-in-one* model, support for **DoRA** networks, additional **VLM** models, new **AuraSR** upscaler  

**Breaking Changes...**

Due to internal changes, you'll need to reset your **attention** and **offload** settings!  
But...For a good reason, new *balanced offload* is magic when it comes to memory utilization while sacrificing minimal performance!

### Details for 2024-08-31

**New Models...**

To use and of the new models, simply select model from *Networks -> Reference* and it will be auto-downloaded on first use  

- [Black Forest Labs FLUX.1](https://blackforestlabs.ai/announcing-black-forest-labs/)  
  FLUX.1 models are based on a hybrid architecture of multimodal and parallel diffusion transformer blocks, scaled to 12B parameters and builing on flow matching  
  This is a very large model at ~32GB in size, its recommended to use a) offloading, b) quantization  
  For more information on variations, requirements, options, and how to donwload and use FLUX.1, see [Wiki](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/wiki/FLUX)  
  SD.Next supports:  
  - [FLUX.1 Dev](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev) and [FLUX.1 Schnell](https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-schnell) original variations  
  - additional [qint8](https://huggingface.co/Disty0/FLUX.1-dev-qint8) and [qint4](https://huggingface.co/Disty0/FLUX.1-dev-qint4) quantized variations  
  - additional [nf4](https://huggingface.co/sayakpaul/flux.1-dev-nf4) quantized variation  
- [AuraFlow](https://huggingface.co/fal/AuraFlow)  
  AuraFlow v0.3 is the fully open-sourced largest flow-based text-to-image generation model  
  This is a very large model at 6.8B params and nearly 31GB in size, smaller variants are expected in the future  
  Use scheduler: Default or Euler FlowMatch or Heun FlowMatch  
- [AlphaVLLM Lumina-Next-SFT](https://huggingface.co/Alpha-VLLM/Lumina-Next-SFT-diffusers)  
  Lumina-Next-SFT is a Next-DiT model containing 2B parameters, enhanced through high-quality supervised fine-tuning (SFT)  
  This model uses T5 XXL variation of text encoder (previous version of Lumina used Gemma 2B as text encoder)  
  Use scheduler: Default or Euler FlowMatch or Heun FlowMatch  
- [Kwai Kolors](https://huggingface.co/Kwai-Kolors/Kolors)  
  Kolors is a large-scale text-to-image generation model based on latent diffusion  
  This is an SDXL style model that replaces standard CLiP-L and CLiP-G text encoders with a massive `chatglm3-6b` encoder supporting both English and Chinese prompting  
- [HunyuanDiT 1.2](https://huggingface.co/Tencent-Hunyuan/HunyuanDiT-v1.2-Diffusers)

**New Features...**

- support for **Balanced Offload**, thanks @Disty0!  
  balanced offload will dynamically split and offload models from the GPU based on the max configured GPU and CPU memory size  
  model parts that dont fit in the GPU will be dynamically sliced and offloaded to the CPU  
  see *Settings -> Diffusers Settings -> Max GPU memory and Max CPU memory*  
  *note*: recommended value for max GPU memory is ~80% of your total GPU memory  
  *note*: balanced offload will force loading LoRA with Diffusers method  
  *note*: balanced offload is not compatible with Optimum Quanto  
- support for **Optimum Quanto** with 8 bit and 4 bit quantization options, thanks @Disty0 and @Trojaner!  
  to use, go to Settings -> Compute Settings and enable "Quantize Model weights with Optimum Quanto" option

Following zero-day **SD3** release, a 10 days later heres a refresh with 10+ improvements  
including full prompt attention, support for compressed weights, additional text-encoder quantization modes.  

But theres more than SD3:  
- support for quantized **T5** text encoder *FP16/FP8/FP4/INT8* in all models that use T5: SD3, PixArt-Σ, etc.  
- support for **PixArt-Sigma** in small/medium/large variants  
- support for **HunyuanDiT 1.1**  
- additional **NNCF weights compression** support: SD3, PixArt, ControlNet, Lora  
- integration of **MS Florence** VLM/VQA *Base* and *Large* models  
- (finally) new release of **Torch-DirectML**  
- additional efficiencies for users with low VRAM GPUs  
- over 20 overall fixes

#### New models

While still waiting for *Stable Diffusion 3.0*, there have been some significant models released in the meantime:

- [PixArt-Σ](https://pixart-alpha.github.io/PixArt-sigma-project/), high end diffusion transformer model (*DiT*) capable of directly generating images at 4K resolution  
- [SDXS](https://github.com/IDKiro/sdxs), extremely fast 1-step generation consistency model  
- [Hyper-SD](https://huggingface.co/ByteDance/Hyper-SD), 1-step, 2-step, 4-step and 8-step optimized models  

*Note*  
[SD.Next](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic) is no longer marked as a fork of [A1111](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/) and github project has been fully detached  
Given huge number of changes with *+3443/-3342* commits diff (at the time of fork detach) over the past year,  
a completely different backend/engine and a change of focus, it is time to give credit to original [author](https://github.com/auTOMATIC1111),  and move on!  

### Full ChangeLog for 2024-05-28

- **Features**:
  - **ModernUI** preview of the new [ModernUI](https://github.com/BinaryQuantumSoul/sdnext-modernui)  
  - [PWA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps) SD.Next is now installable as a web-app and includes verified manifest  
  - **Gallery
  - **Gallery**: list, preview, search through all your images and videos!  
    Implemented as infinite-scroll with client-side-caching and lazy-loading while being fully async and non-blocking  
    Search or sort by path, name, size, width, height, mtime or any image metadata item, also with extended syntax like *width > 1000*  
    *Settings*: optional additional user-defined folders, thumbnails in fixed or variable aspect-ratio  
  - [HiDiffusion](https://github.com/megvii-research/HiDiffusion):  
    Generate high-resolution images using your standard models without duplicates/distorsions AND improved performance  
    For example, *SD15* can now go up to *2024x2048* and *SDXL* up to *4k* natively
    Simply enable checkbox in advanced menu and set desired resolution  
    Additional settings are available in *settings -> inference settings -> hidiffusion*  
    And can also be set and used via *xyz grid*  
    *Note*: HiDiffusion resolution sensitive, so if you get error, set resolution to be multiples of 128  
  - [Perturbed-Attention Guidance](https://github.com/KU-CVLAB/Perturbed-Attention-Guidance)  
    PAG enhances sample quality by utilizing self-attention in formation of latent in addition to standard CFG scale  
    Simply set *advanced -> attention guidance* and *advanced -> adaptive scaling*  
    Additional options are available in *settings -> inference settings -> pag*  
    *Note*: PAG has replaced SAG as attention guidance method in SD.Next  
  - [LayerDiffuse](https://github.com/rootonchair/diffuser_layerdiffuse)
    Create transparent images with foreground-only being generated  
    Simply select from scripts -> apply to current model  
    All necessary files will be auto-downloaded on first use  
  - **IP Adapter Masking**:  
    Powerful method of using masking with ip-adapters  
    When combined with multiple ip-adapters, it allows for different inputs guidance for each segment of the input image  
    *Hint*: to create masks, you can use manually created masks or control->mask module with auto-segment to create masks and later upload them  
  - **IP Adapter advanced layer configuration**:  
    Allows for more control over how each layer of ip-adapter is applied, requires a valid dict to be passed as input  
    See [InstantStyle](https://github.com/InstantStyle/InstantStyle) for details  
  - **OneDiff**: new optimization/compile engine, thanks @aifartist  
    As with all other compile engines, enable via *settings -> compute settings -> compile*  
  - [ToDo](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.13573v2) Token Downsampling for Efficient Generation of High-Resolution Images  
    Newer alternative method to [ToMe](https://github.com/dbolya/tomesd) that can provide speed-up with minimal quality loss  
    Enable in *settings -> inference settings -> token merging*  
    Also available in XYZ grid  
  - **Outpaint**:  
    New method of outpainting that uses a combination of auto-masking and edge generation to create seamless transitions between original and generated image  
    Use on control tab:
    - *input -> denoising strength: 0.5 or higher*
    - *select image -> outpaint -> expand edges or zoom out to desired size*
    - *size -> mode: outpaint, method: nearest*
    - *mask -> inpaint masked only (if you want to keep original image)*
  - **Wildcards**:
    - native support of standard file-based wildcards in prompt  
    - enabled by default, can be disabled in *settings -> extra networks* if you want to use 3rd party extension  
    - wildcards folder is set in *settings -> system paths* and can be flat-file list or complex folder structure  
    - matches strings `"__*__"` in positive and negative prompts  
    - supports filename and path-based wildcards  
    - supports nested wildcards (wildcard can refer to another wildcard, etc.)  
    - supports wildcards files in one-choice per line or multiple choices per line separated by `|` format  
    - *note*: this is in addition to previously released style-based wildcards  
- **Models**:
  - **Load UNET**: ability to override/load external UNET to a selected model  
    Works similar to how VAE is selected and loaded: Set UNet folder and UNet model in settings  
    Can be replaced on-the-fly, not just during initial model load  
    Enables usage of fine-tunes such as [DPO-SD15](https://huggingface.co/mhdang/dpo-sd1.5-text2image-v1) or [DPO-SDXL](https://huggingface.co/mhdang/dpo-sdxl-text2image-v1)  
    *Note*: if there is a `JSON` file with the same name as the model it will be used as Unet config, otherwise Unet config from currently loaded model will be used  
  - [PixArt-Σ](https://pixart-alpha.github.io/PixArt-sigma-project/)
    pixart-Σ is a high end diffusion Transformer model (DiT) with a T5 encoder/decoder capable of directly generating images at 4K resolution  
    to use, simply select from *networks -> models -> reference -> PixArt-Σ*  
    *note*: this is a very large model at ~22GB  
    set parameters: *sampler: Default*  
  - [SDXS](https://github.com/IDKiro/sdxs)
    sdxs is an extremely fast 1-step generation consistency model that also uses TAESD as quick VAE out-of-the-box  
    to use, simply select from *networks -> models -> reference -> SDXS*  
    set parameters: *sampler: CMSI, steps: 1, cfg_scale: 0.0*
  - [Hyper-SD](https://huggingface.co/ByteDance/Hyper-SD)  
    sd15 and sdxl 1-step, 2-step, 4-step and 8-step optimized models using lora  
    set parameters: *sampler: TCD or LCM, steps: 1/2/4/8, cfg_scale: 0.0*  
- **UI**:
  - Faster **UI** load times
  - Theme types:  
    **Standard** (built-in themes), **Modern** (experimental nextgen ui), **None** (used for Gradio and Huggingface 3rd party themes)  
    Specifying a theme type updates list of available themes  
    For example, *Gradio* themes will not appear as available if theme type is set to *Standard*  
  - Redesign of base txt2img interface  
  - Minor tweaks to styles: refresh/apply/save
  - See details in [WiKi](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/wiki/Themes)
- **API**:
  - Add API endpoint `/sdapi/v1/control` and CLI util `cli/simple-control.py`  
    (in addition to previously added `/sdapi/v1/preprocessors` and `/sdapi/v1/masking`)  
    example:
    > simple-control.py --prompt 'woman in the city' --sampler UniPC --steps 20  
    > --input \~/generative/Samples/cutie-512.png --output /tmp/test.png --processed /tmp/proc.png  
    > --control 'Canny:Canny FP16:0.7, OpenPose:OpenPose FP16:0.8' --type controlnet  
    > --ipadapter 'Plus:~/generative/Samples/cutie-512.png:0.5'  
  - Add API endpoint `/sdapi/v1/vqa` and CLI util `cli/simple-vqa.py`
- **Changes**:
  - Due to change in Diffusers model loading  
    initial model load will now fetch config files required for the model  
    from the Huggingface site instead of using predefined YAML files
  - Removed built-in extensions: *ControlNet* and *Image-Browser*  
    as both *image-browser* and *controlnet* have native built-in equivalents  
    both can still be installed by user if desired  
  - Different defaults depending on available GPU, thanks @Disty0
    - 4GB and below: *lowvram*
    - 8GB and below: *medvram*
    - Cross-attention: Dynamic Attention SDP with *medvram* or *lowvram*, otherwise SDP  
    - VAE Tiling enabled with *medvram* and *lowvram*
    - Disable Extract EMA by default
    - Disable forced VAE Slicing for *lowvram*
  - Upscaler compile disabled by default with OpenVINO backend  
  - Hypernetwork support disabled by default, can be enabled in settings  
- **Improvements**:
  - Faster server startup  
  - Styles apply wildcards to params
  - Face HiRes fully configurable and higher quality when using high-resolution models  
  - Extra networks persistent sort order in settings  
  - Add option to make batch generations use fully random seed vs sequential  
  - Make metadata in full screen viewer optional
  - Add VAE civitai scan metadata/preview
  - More efficient in-browser callbacks
  - Updated all system requirements  
  - UI log monitor will auto-reconnect to server on server restart  
  - UI styles includes indicator for active styles  
  - UI reduce load on browser  
  - Secondary sampler add option "same as primary"  
  - Change attention mechanism on-the-fly without model reload, thanks @Disty0  
  - Update stable-fast with support for torch 2.2.2 and 2.3.0, thanks @Aptronymist
  - Add torch *cudaMallocAsync* in compute options  
    Can improve memory utilization on compatible GPUs (RTX and newer)  
  - Torch dynamic profiling  
    You can enable/disable full torch profiling in settings top menu on-the-fly  
  - Prompt caching - if you use the same prompt multiple times, no need to re-parse and encode it  
    Useful for batches as prompt processing is ~0.1sec on each pass  
  - Enhance `SD_PROMPT_DEBUG` to show actual tokens used
  - Support controlnet manually downloads models in both standalone and diffusers format  
    For standalone, simply copy safetensors file to `models/control/controlnet` folder  
    For diffusers format, create folder with model name in `models/control/controlnet/`  
    and copy `model.json` and `diffusion_pytorch_model.safetensors` to that folder  
- **Samplers**
  - Add *Euler SGM* variation (e.g. SGM Uniform), optimized for SDXL-Lightning models  
    *note*: you can use other samplers as well with SDXL-Lightning models  
  - Add *CMSI* sampler, optimized for consistency models  
  - Add option *timestep spacing* to sampler settings and sampler section in main ui
    Note: changing timestep spacing changes behavior of sampler and can help to make any sampler turbo/lightning compatibile
  - Add option *timesteps* to manually set timesteps instead of relying on steps+spacing  
    Additionally, presets from nVidias align-you-steps reasearch are provided  
    Result is that perfectly aligned steps can drastically reduce number of steps needed!  
    For example, **AYS** preset alows DPM++2M to run in ~10 steps with quality equallying ~30 steps!  
- **IPEX**, thanks @Disty0
  - Update to *IPEX 2.1.20* on Linux  
    requires removing the venv folder to update properly  
  - Removed 1024x1024 workaround

- **IP-Adapters** & **FaceID**: multi-adapter and multi-image suport  
- New optimization engines: [DeepCache](https://github.com/horseee/DeepCache), [ZLUDA](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA) and **Dynamic Attention Slicing**  
- New built-in pipelines: [Differential diffusion](https://github.com/exx8/differential-diffusion) and [Regional prompting](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/examples/community/README.md#regional-prompting-pipeline)  
- Big updates to: **Outpainting** (noised-edge-extend), **Clip-skip** (interpolate with non-integrer values!), **CFG end** (prevent overburn on high CFG scales), **Control** module masking functionality  
- All reported issues since the last release are addressed and included in this release  

Further details:  
- For basic instructions, see [README](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/blob/master/README.md)  
- For more details on all new features see full [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)  
- For documentation, see [WiKi](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/wiki)
- [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/sd-next-federal-batch-inspectors-1101998836328697867) server  

### Full ChangeLog for 2024-02-22

- **Improvements**:
  - **IP Adapter** major refactor  
    - support for **multiple input images** per each ip adapter  
    - support for **multiple concurrent ip adapters**  
      *note*: you cannot mix & match ip adapters that use different *CLiP* models, for example `Base` and `Base ViT-G`  
    - add **adapter start/end** to settings, thanks @AI-Casanova  
      having adapter start late can help with better control over composition and prompt adherence  
      having adapter end early can help with overal quality and performance  
    - unified interface in txt2img, img2img and control  
    - enhanced xyz grid support  
  - **FaceID** now also works with multiple input images!  
  - [Differential diffusion](https://github.com/exx8/differential-diffusion)  
    img2img generation where you control strength of each pixel or image area  
    can be used with manually created masks or with auto-generated depth-maps
    uses general denoising strength value  
    simply enable from *img2img -> scripts -> differential diffusion*  
    *note*: supports sd15 and sdxl models  
  - [Regional prompting](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/examples/community/README.md#regional-prompting-pipeline) as a built-in solution  
    usage is same as original implementation from @hako-mikan  
    click on title to open docs and see examples of full syntax on how to use it  
    simply enable from *scripts -> regional prompting*  
    *note*: supports sd15 models only  
  - [DeepCache](https://github.com/horseee/DeepCache) model acceleration  
    it can produce massive speedups (2x-5x) with no overhead, but with some loss of quality  
    *settings -> compute -> model compile -> deep-cache* and *settings -> compute -> model compile -> cache interval*  
  - [ZLUDA](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA) experimental support, thanks @lshqqytiger  
    - ZLUDA is CUDA wrapper that can be used for GPUs without native support
    - best use case is *AMD GPUs on Windows*, see [wiki](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/wiki/ZLUDA) for details  
  - **Outpaint** control outpaint now uses new alghorithm: noised-edge-extend  
    new method allows for much larger outpaint areas in a single pass, even outpaint 512->1024 works well  
    note that denoise strength should be increased for larger the outpaint areas, for example outpainting 512->1024 works well with denoise 0.75  
    outpaint can run in *img2img* mode (default) and *inpaint* mode where original image is masked (if inpaint masked only is selected)  
  - **Clip-skip** reworked completely, thanks @AI-Casanova & @Disty0  
    now clip-skip range is 0-12 where previously lowest value was 1 (default is still 1)  
    values can also be decimal to interpolate between different layers, for example `clip-skip: 1.5`, thanks @AI-Casanova  
  - **CFG End** new param to control image generation guidance, thanks @AI-Casanova  
    sometimes you want strong control over composition, but you want it to stop at some point  
    for example, when used with ip-adapters or controlnet, high cfg scale can overpower the guided image  
  - **Control**
    - when performing inpainting, you can specify processing resolution using **size->mask**  
    - units now have extra option to re-use current preview image as processor input  
  - **Cross-attention** refactored cross-attention methods, thanks @Disty0  
    - for backend:original, its unchanged: SDP, xFormers, Doggettxs, InvokeAI, Sub-quadratic, Split attention  
    - for backend:diffuers, list is now: SDP, xFormers, Batch matrix-matrix, Split attention, Dynamic Attention BMM, Dynamic Attention SDP  
      note: you may need to update your settings! Attention Slicing is renamed to Split attention  
    - for ROCm, updated default cross-attention to Scaled Dot Product  
  - **Dynamic Attention Slicing**, thanks @Disty0  
    - dynamically slices attention queries in order to keep them under the slice rate  
      slicing gets only triggered if the query size is larger than the slice rate to gain performance  
      *Dynamic Attention Slicing BMM* uses *Batch matrix-matrix*  
      *Dynamic Attention Slicing SDP* uses *Scaled Dot Product*  
    - *settings -> compute settings -> attention -> dynamic attention slicing*  
  - **ONNX**:  
    - allow specify onnx default provider and cpu fallback  
      *settings -> diffusers*  
    - allow manual install of specific onnx flavor  
      *settings -> onnx*  
    - better handling of `fp16` models/vae, thanks @lshqqytiger  
  - **OpenVINO** update to `torch 2.2.0`, thanks @Disty0  
  - **HyperTile** additional options thanks @Disty0  
    - add swap size option  
    - add use only for hires pass option  
  - add `--theme` cli param to force theme on startup

  - added benchmark notes for IPEX, OpenVINO and Olive  
  - added ZLUDA wiki page  
- **Internal**
  - update dependencies  
  - refactor txt2img/img2img api

## Update for 2024-02-07

Another big release just hit the shelves!

### Highlights 2024-02-07  

- A lot more functionality in the **Control** module:
  - Inpaint and outpaint support, flexible resizing options, optional hires  
  - Built-in support for many new processors and models, all auto-downloaded on first use  
  - Full support for scripts and extensions  
- Complete **Face** module  
  implements all variations of **FaceID**, **FaceSwap** and latest **PhotoMaker** and **InstantID**  
- Much enhanced **IPAdapter** modules  
- Brand new **Intelligent masking**, manual or automatic  
  Using ML models (*LAMA* object removal, *REMBG* background removal, *SAM* segmentation, etc.) and with live previews  
  With granular blur, erode and dilate controls  
- New models and pipelines:  
  **Segmind SegMoE**, **Mixture Tiling**, **InstaFlow**, **SAG**, **BlipDiffusion**  
- Massive work integrating latest advances with [OpenVINO](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/wiki/OpenVINO), [IPEX](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/wiki/Intel-ARC) and [ONNX Olive](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/wiki/ONNX-Runtime-&-Olive)
- Full control over brightness, sharpness and color shifts and color grading during generate process directly in latent space  
- **Documentation**! This was a big one, with a lot of new content and updates in the [WiKi](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/wiki)  

Plus welcome additions to **UI performance, usability and accessibility** and flexibility of deployment as well as **API** improvements  
And it also includes fixes for all reported issues so far  

As of this release, default backend is set to **diffusers** as its more feature rich than **original** and supports many additional models (original backend does remain as fully supported)  

Also, previous versions of **SD.Next** were tuned for balance between performance and resource usage.  
With this release, focus is more on performance.  
See [Benchmark](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/wiki/Benchmark) notes for details, but as a highlight, we are now hitting **~110-150 it/s** on a standard nVidia RTX4090 in optimal scenarios!  

Further details:  
- For basic instructions, see [README](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/blob/master/README.md)  
- For more details on all new features see full [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)  
- For documentation, see [WiKi](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/wiki)

### Full ChangeLog 2024-02-07  

- Heavily updated [Wiki](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/wiki)  
- **Control**:  
  - new docs:
    - [Control overview](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/wiki/Control)  
    - [Control guide](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/wiki/Control-Guide), thanks @Aptronymist  
  - add **inpaint** support  
    applies to both *img2img* and *controlnet* workflows  
  - add **outpaint** support  
    applies to both *img2img* and *controlnet* workflows  
    *note*: increase denoising strength since outpainted area is blank by default  
  - new **mask** module  
    - granular blur (gaussian), erode (reduce or remove noise) and dilate (pad or expand)  
    - optional **live preview**  
    - optional **auto-segmentation** using ml models  
      auto-segmentation can be done using **segment-anything** models or **rembg** models  
      *note*: auto segmentation will automatically expand user-masked area to segments that include current user mask  
    - optional **auto-mask**  
      if you dont provide mask or mask is empty, you can instead use auto-mask to automatically generate mask  
      this is especially useful if you want to use advanced masking on batch or video inputs and dont want to manually mask each image  
      *note*: such auto-created mask is also subject to all other selected settings such as auto-segmentation, blur, erode and dilate  
    - optional **object removal** using LaMA model  
      remove selected objects from images with a single click  
      works best when combined with auto-segmentation to remove smaller objects  
    - masking can be combined with control processors in which case mask is applied before processor  
    - unmasked part of can is optionally applied to final image as overlay, see settings `mask_apply_overlay`  
  - support for many additional controlnet models  
    now built-in models include 30+ SD15 models and 15+ SDXL models  
  - allow **resize** both *before* and *after* generate operation  
    this allows for workflows such as: *image -> upscale or downscale -> generate -> upscale or downscale -> output*  
    providing more flexibility and than standard hires workflow  
    *note*: resizing before generate can be done using standard upscalers or latent
  - implicit **hires**  
    since hires is only used for txt2img, control reuses existing resize functionality
    any image size is used as txt2img target size  
    but if resize scale is also set its used to additionally upscale image after initial txt2img and for hires pass  
  - add support for **scripts** and **extensions**  
    you can now combine control workflow with your favorite script or extension  
    *note* extensions that are hard-coded for txt2img or img2img tabs may not work until they are updated  
  - add **depth-anything** depth map processor and trained controlnet  
  - add **marigold** depth map processor  
    this is state-of-the-art depth estimation model, but its quite heavy on resources  
  - add **openpose xl** controlnet  
  - add blip/booru **interrogate** functionality to both input and output images  
  - configurable output folder in settings  
  - auto-refresh available models on tab activate  
  - add image preview for override images set per-unit  
  - more compact unit layout  
  - reduce usage of temp files  
  - add context menu to action buttons  
  - move ip-adapter implementation to control tabs  
  - resize by now applies to input image or frame individually  
    allows for processing where input images are of different sizes  
  - support controlnets with non-default yaml config files  
  - implement resize modes for override images  
  - allow any selection of units  
  - dynamically install depenencies required by specific processors  
  - fix input image size  
  - fix video color mode  
  - fix correct image mode  
  - fix batch/folder/video modes  
  - fix processor switching within same unit  
  - fix pipeline switching between different modes  
- **Face** module  
  implements all variations of **FaceID**, **FaceSwap** and latest **PhotoMaker** and **InstantID**  
  simply select from scripts and choose your favorite method and model  
  *note*: all models are auto-downloaded on first use  
  - [FaceID](https://huggingface.co/h94/IP-Adapter-FaceID)  
    - faceid guides image generation given the input image

    additionally, all model-moves can now be traced with env variable `SD_MOVE_DEBUG`  
  - **xyz grid**
    - range control  
      example: `5.0-6.0:3` will generate 3 images with values `5.0,5.5,6.0`

## Update for 2023-11-06

Another pretty big release, this time with focus on new models (3 new model types), new backends and optimizations
Plus quite a few fixes  

Also, [Wiki](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/wiki) has been updated with new content, so check it out!  
Some highlights: [OpenVINO](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/wiki/OpenVINO), [IntelArc](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/wiki/Intel-ARC), [DirectML](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/wiki/DirectML), [ONNX/Olive](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/wiki/ONNX-Olive)

- **Diffusers**
  - since now **SD.Next** supports **12** different model types, weve added reference model for each type in  
    *Extra networks -> Reference* for easier select & auto-download  
    Models can still be downloaded manually, this is just a convenience feature & a showcase for supported models  
  - new model type: [Segmind SSD-1B](https://huggingface.co/segmind/SSD-1B)  
    its a *distilled* model trained at 1024px, this time 50% smaller and faster version of SD-XL!  
    (and quality does not suffer, its just more optimized)  
    test shows batch-size:4 with 1k images at full quality used less than 6.5GB of VRAM  
    and for further optimization, you can use built-in **TAESD** decoder,  
    which results in batch-size:16 with 1k images using 7.9GB of VRAM
    select from extra networks -> reference or download using built-in **Huggingface** downloader: `segmind/SSD-1B`  
  - new model type: [Pixart-α XL 2](https://github.com/PixArt-alpha/PixArt-alpha)  
    in medium/512px and large/1024px variations  
    comparable in quality to SD 1.5 and SD-XL, but with better text encoder and highly optimized training pipeline  
    so finetunes can be done in as little as 10% compared to SD/SD-XL (note that due to much larger text encoder, it is a large model)  
    select from extra networks -> reference or download using built-in **Huggingface** downloader: `PixArt-alpha/PixArt-XL-2-1024-MS`  
  - new model type: [LCM: Latent Consistency Models](https://github.com/openai/consistency_models)  
    trained at 512px, but with near-instant generate in a as little as 3 steps!  
    combined with OpenVINO, generate on CPU takes less than 5-10 seconds: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b90ESUTLsRo>  
    and absolute beast when combined with **HyperTile** and **TAESD** decoder resulting in **28 FPS**  
    (on RTX4090 for batch 16x16 at 512px)  
    note: set sampler to **Default** before loading model as LCM comes with its own *LCMScheduler* sampler  
    select from extra networks -> reference or download using built-in **Huggingface** downloader: `SimianLuo/LCM_Dreamshaper_v7`  
  - support for **Custom pipelines**, thanks @disty0  
    download using built-in **Huggingface** downloader  
    think of them as plugins for diffusers not unlike original extensions that modify behavior of `ldm` backend  
    list of community pipelines: <https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/blob/main/examples/community/README.md>  
  - new custom pipeline: `Disty0/zero123plus-pipeline`, thanks @disty0  
    generate 4 output images with different camera positions: front, side, top, back!  
    for more details, see <https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/discussions/2421>  
  - new backend: **ONNX/Olive** *(experimental)*, thanks @lshqqytiger  
    for details, see [WiKi](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/wiki/ONNX-Runtime)
  - extend support for [Free-U](https://github.com/ChenyangSi/FreeU)  
    improve generations quality at no cost (other than finding params that work for you)  
- **General**  
  - attempt to auto-fix invalid samples which occur due to math errors in lower precision  
    example: `RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered in cast: sample = sample.astype(np.uint8)`  
    begone **black images** *(note: if it proves as working, this solution will need to be expanded to cover all scenarios)*  
  - add **Lora OFT** support, thanks @antis0007 and @ai-casanova  
  - **Upscalers**  
    - **compile** option, thanks @disty0  
    - **chaiNNer** add high quality models from [Helaman](https://openmodeldb.info/users/helaman)

  - new option: *settings -> images -> keep incomplete*  
    can be used to skip vae decode on aborted/skipped/interrupted image generations  
  - new option: *settings -> system paths -> models*  
    can be used to set custom base path for *all* models (previously only as cli option)  
  - remove external clone of items in `/repositories`  
  - **Interrogator** module has been removed from `extensions-builtin`  
    and fully implemented (and improved) natively  
- **UI**  
  - UI tweaks for default themes  
  - UI switch core font in default theme to **noto-sans**  
    previously default font was simply *system-ui*, but it lead to too much variations between browsers and platforms  
  - UI tweaks for mobile devices, thanks @iDeNoh  
  - updated **Context menu**  
    right-click on any button in action menu (e.g. generate button)

## Update for 2023-10-17

This is a major release, with many changes and new functionality...  

Changelog is massive, but do read through or youll be missing on some very cool new functionality  
or even free speedups and quality improvements (regardless of which workflows youre using)!  

Note that for this release its recommended to perform a clean install (e.g. fresh `git clone`)  
Upgrades are still possible and supported, but clean install is recommended for best experience  

- **UI**  
  - added **change log** to UI  
    see *System -> Changelog*  
  - converted submenus from checkboxes to accordion elements  
    any ui state including state of open/closed menus can be saved as default!  
    see *System -> User interface -> Set menu states*  
  - new built-in theme **invoked**  
    thanks @BinaryQuantumSoul  
  - add **compact view** option in settings -> user interface  
  - small visual indicator bottom right of page showing internal server job state  
- **Extra networks**:  
  - **Details**  
    - new details interface to view and save data about extra networks  
      main ui now has a single button on each en to trigger details view  
    - details view includes model/lora metadata parser!  
    - details view includes civitai model metadata!  
  - **Metadata**:  
    - you can scan [civitai](https://civitai.com/)  
      for missing metadata and previews directly from extra networks  
      simply click on button in top-right corner of extra networks page  
  - **Styles**  
    - save/apply icons moved to extra networks  
    - can be edited in details view  
    - support for single or multiple styles per json  
    - support for embedded previews  
    - large database of art styles included by default  
      can be disabled in *settings -> extra networks -> show built-in*  
    - styles can also be used in a prompt directly: `<style:style_name>`  
      if style if an exact match, it will be used  
      otherwise it will rotate between styles that match the start of the name  
      that way you can use different styles as wildcards when processing batches  
    - styles can have **extra** fields, not just prompt and negative prompt  
      for example: *"Extra: sampler: Euler a, width: 480, height: 640, steps: 30, cfg scale: 10, clip skip: 2"*
  - **VAE**  
    - VAEs are now also listed as part of extra networks  
    - Image preview methods have been redesigned: simple, approximate, taesd, full  
      please set desired preview method in settings  
    - both original and diffusers backend now support "full quality" setting  
      if you desired model or platform does not support FP16 and/or you have a low-end hardware and cannot use FP32  
      you can disable "full quality" in advanced params and it will likely reduce decode errors (infamous black images)  
  - **LoRA**  
    - LoRAs are now automatically filtered based on compatibility with currently loaded model  
      note that if lora type cannot be auto-determined, it will be left in the list  
  - **Refiner**  
    - you can load model from extra networks as base model or as refiner  
      simply select button in top-right of models page  
  - **General**  
    - faster search, ability to show/hide/sort networks  
    - refactored subfolder handling  
      *note*: this will trigger model hash recalculation on first model use  
- **Diffusers**:  
  - better pipeline **auto-detect** when loading from safetensors  
  - **SDXL Inpaint**  
    - although any model can be used for inpainiting, there is a case to be made for  
      dedicated inpainting models as they are tuned to inpaint and not generate  
    - model can be used as base model for **img2img** or refiner model for **txt2img**  
      To download go to *Models -> Huggingface*:  
      - `diffusers/stable-diffusion-xl-1.0-inpainting-0.1` *(6.7GB)*  
  - **SDXL Instruct-Pix2Pix**  
    - model can be used as base model for **img2img** or refiner model for **txt2img**  
      this model is massive and requires a lot of resources!  
      to download go to *Models -> Huggingface*:  
      - `diffusers/sdxl-instructpix2pix-768` *(11.9GB)*  
  - **SD Latent Upscale**  
    - you can use *SD Latent Upscale* models as **refiner models**  
      this is a bit experimental, but it works quite well!  
      to download go to *Models -> Huggingface*:  
      - `stabilityai/sd-x2-latent-upscaler` *(2.2GB)*  
      - `stabilityai/stable-diffusion-x4-upscaler` *(1.7GB)*  
  - better **Prompt attention**  
    should better handle more complex prompts  
    for sdxl, choose which part of prompt goes to second text encoder - just add `TE2:` separator in the prompt  
    for hires and refiner, second pass prompt is used if present, otherwise primary prompt is used  
    new option in *settings -> diffusers -> sdxl pooled embeds*  
    thanks @AI-Casanova  
  - better **Hires** support for SD and SDXL  
  - better **TI embeddings** support for SD and SDXL  
    faster loading, wider compatibility and support for embeddings with multiple vectors  
    information about used embedding is now also added to image metadata  
    thanks @AI-Casanova  
  - better **Lora** handling  
    thanks @AI-Casanova  
  - better **SDXL preview** quality (approx method)  
    thanks @BlueAmulet
  - new setting: *settings -> diffusers -> force inpaint*  
    as some models behave better when in *inpaint* mode even for normal *img2img* tasks  
- **Upscalers**:
  - pretty much a rewrite and tons of new upscalers - built-in list is now at **42**  
  - fix long outstanding memory leak in legacy code, amazing this went undetected for so long  
  - more high quality upscalers available by default  
    **SwinIR** (2), **ESRGAN** (12), **RealESRGAN** (6), **SCUNet** (2)  
  - if that is not enough, there is new **chaiNNer** integration:  
    adds 15 more upscalers from different families out-of-the-box:  
    **HAT** (6), **RealHAT** (2), **DAT** (1), **RRDBNet** (1), **SPSRNet** (1), **SRFormer** (2), **SwiftSR** (2)  
    and yes, you can download and add your own, just place them in `models/chaiNNer`  
  - two additional latent upscalers based on SD upscale models when using Diffusers backend  
    **SD Upscale 2x**, **SD Upscale 4x***  
    note: Recommended usage for *SD Upscale* is by using second pass instead of upscaler  
    as it allows for tuning of prompt, seed, sampler settings which are used to guide upscaler  
  - upscalers are available in **xyz grid**  
  - simplified *settings->postprocessing->upscalers*  
    e.g. all upsamplers share same settings for tiling  
  - allow upscale-only as part of **txt2img** and **img2img** workflows  
    simply set *denoising strength* to 0 so hires does not get triggered  
  - unified init/download/execute/progress code  
  - easier installation  
- **Samplers**:  
  - moved ui options to submenu  
  - default list for new installs is now all samplers, list can be modified in settings  
  - simplified samplers configuration in settings  
    plus added few new ones like sigma min/max which can highly impact sampler behavior  
  - note that list of samplers is now *different* since keeping a flat-list of all possible  
    combinations results in 50+ samplers which is not practical  
    items such as algorithm (e.g. karras) is actually a sampler option, not a sampler itself  
- **CivitAI**:
  - civitai model download is now multithreaded and resumable  
    meaning that you can download multiple models in parallel  
    as well as resume aborted/incomplete downloads  
  - civitai integration in *models -> civitai* can now find most  
    previews AND metadata for most models (checkpoints, loras, embeddings)  
    metadata is now parsed and saved in *[model].json*  
    typical hit rate is >95% for models, loras and embeddings  
  - description from parsed model metadata is used as model description if there is no manual  
    description file present in format of *[model].txt*  
  - to enable search for models, make sure all models have set hash values  
    *Models -> Valida -> Calculate hashes*  
- **LoRA**
  - new unified LoRA handler for all LoRA types (lora, lyco, loha, lokr, locon, ia3, etc.)  
    applies to both original and diffusers backend  
    thanks @AI-Casanova for diffusers port  
  - for *backend:original*, separate lyco handler has been removed  
- **Compute**  
  - **CUDA**:  
    - default updated to `torch` *2.1.0* with cuda *12.1*  
    - testing moved to `torch` *2.2.0-dev/cu122*  
    - check out *generate context menu -> show nvml* for live gpu stats (memory, power, temp, clock, etc.)
  - **Intel Arc/IPEX**:  
    - tons of optimizations, built-in binary wheels for Windows  
      i have to say, intel arc/ipex is getting to be quite a player, especially with openvino  
      thanks @Disty0 @Nuullll  
  - **AMD ROCm**:  
    - updated installer to support detect `ROCm` *5.4/5.5/5.6/5.7*  
    - support for `torch-rocm-5.7`
  - **xFormers**:
    - default updated to *0.0.23*  
    - note that latest xformers are still not compatible with cuda 12.1  
      recommended to use torch 2.1.0 with cuda 11.8  
      if you attempt to use xformers with cuda 12.1, it will force a full xformers rebuild on install  
      which can take a very long time and may/may-not work  
    - added cmd param `--use-xformers` to force usage of exformers  
  - **GC**:

    default minimal style has been updated for compatibility, but actual styling is completely outside of SD.Next control  

## Update for 2023-09-13

Started as a mostly a service release with quite a few fixes, but then...  
Major changes how **hires** works as well as support for a very interesting new model [Wuerstchen](https://huggingface.co/blog/wuertschen)  

- tons of fixes  
- changes to **hires**  
  - enable non-latent upscale modes (standard upscalers)  
  - when using latent upscale, hires pass is run automatically  
  - when using non-latent upscalers, hires pass is skipped by default  
    enabled using **force hires** option in ui  
    hires was not designed to work with standard upscalers, but i understand this is a common workflow  
  - when using refiner, upscale/hires runs before refiner pass  
  - second pass can now also utilize full/quick vae quality  
  - note that when combining non-latent upscale, hires and refiner output quality is maximum,  
    but operations are really resource intensive as it includes: *base->decode->upscale->encode->hires->refine*
  - all combinations of: decode full/quick + upscale none/latent/non-latent + hires on/off + refiner on/off  
    should be supported, but given the number of combinations, issues are possible  
  - all operations are captured in image metadata
- diffusers:
  - allow loading of sd/sdxl models from safetensors without online connectivity
  - support for new model: [wuerstchen](https://huggingface.co/warp-ai/wuerstchen)  
    its a high-resolution model (1024px+) thats ~40% faster than sd-xl with a bit lower resource requirements  
    go to *models -> huggingface -> search "warp-ai/wuerstchen" -> download*  
    its nearly 12gb in size, so be patient :)
- minor re-layout of the main ui  
- updated **ui hints**  
- updated **models -> civitai**  
  - search and download loras  
  - find previews for already downloaded models or loras  
- new option **inference mode**  
  - default is standard `torch.no_grad`  
    new option is `torch.inference_only` which is slightly faster and uses less vram, but only works on some gpus  
- new cmdline param `--no-metadata`  
  skips reading metadata from models that are not already cached  
- updated **gradio**  
- **styles** support for subfolders  
- **css** optimizations
- clean-up **logging**  
  - capture system info in startup log  
  - better diagnostic output  
  - capture extension output  
  - capture ldm output  
  - cleaner server restart  
  - custom exception handling

## Update for 2023-09-06

One week later, another large update!

- system:  
  - full **python 3.11** support  
    note that changing python version does require reinstall  
    and if youre already on python 3.10, really no need to upgrade  
- themes:  
  - new default theme: **black-teal**  
  - new light theme: **light-teal**  
  - new additional theme: **midnight-barbie**, thanks @nyxia  
- extra networks:  
  - support for **tags**  
    show tags on hover, search by tag, list tags, add to prompt, etc.  
  - **styles** are now also listed as part of extra networks  
    existing `styles.csv` is converted upon startup to individual styles inside `models/style`  
    this is stage one of new styles functionality  
    old styles interface is still available, but will be removed in future  
  - cache file lists for much faster startup  
    speedups are 50+% for large number of extra networks  
  - ui refresh button now refreshes selected page, not all pages  
  - simplified handling of **descriptions**  
    now shows on-mouse-over without the need for user interaction  
  - **metadata** and **info** buttons only show if there is actual content  
- diffusers:  
  - add full support for **textual inversions** (embeddings)  
    this applies to both sd15 and sdxl  
    thanks @ai-casanova for porting compel/sdxl code  
  - mix&match **base** and **refiner** models (*experimental*):  
    most of those are "because why not" and can result in corrupt images, but some are actually useful  
    also note that if youre not using actual refiner model, you need to bump refiner steps  
    as normal models are not designed to work with low step count  
    and if youre having issues, try setting prompt parser to "fixed attention" as majority of problems  
    are due to token mismatches when using prompt attention  
    - any sd15 + any sd15  
    - any sd15 + sdxl-refiner  
    - any sdxl-base + sdxl-refiner  
    - any sdxl-base + any sd15  
    - any sdxl-base + any sdxl-base  
  - ability to **interrupt** (stop/skip) model generate  
  - added **aesthetics score** setting (for sdxl)  
    used to automatically guide unet towards higher pleasing images  
    highly recommended for simple prompts  
  - added **force zeros** setting  
    create zero-tensor for prompt if prompt is empty (positive or negative)  
- general:  
  - `rembg` remove backgrounds support for **is-net** model  
  - **settings** now show markers for all items set to non-default values  
  - **metadata** refactored how/what/when metadata is added to images  
    should result in much cleaner and more complete metadata  
  - pre-create all system folders on startup  
  - handle model load errors gracefully  
  - improved vram reporting in ui  
  - improved script profiling (when running in debug mode)  

## Update for 2023-08-30

Time for a quite a large update that has been leaking bit-by-bit over the past week or so...  
*Note*: due to large changes, it is recommended to reset (delete) your `ui-config.json`  

- diffusers:  
  - support for **distilled** sd models  
    just go to models/huggingface and download a model, for example:  
    `segmind/tiny-sd`, `segmind/small-sd`, `segmind/portrait-finetuned`  
    those are lower quality, but extremely small and fast  
    up to 50% faster than sd 1.5 and execute in as little as 2.1gb of vram  
- general:  
  - redesigned **settings**  
    - new layout with separated sections:  
      *settings, ui config, licenses, system info, benchmark, models*  
    - **system info** tab is now part of settings  
      when running outside of sdnext, system info is shown in main ui  
    - all system and image paths are now relative by default  
    - add settings validation when performing load/save  
    - settings tab in ui now shows settings that are changed from default values  
    - settings tab switch to compact view  
  - update **gradio** major version  
    this may result in some smaller layout changes since its a major version change  
    however, browser page load is now much faster  
  - optimizations:
    - optimize model hashing  
    - add cli param `--skip-all` that skips all installer checks  
      use at personal discretion, but it can be useful for bulk deployments  
    - add model **precompile** option (when model compile is enabled)  
    - **extra network** folder info caching  
      results in much faster startup when you have large number of extra networks  
    - faster **xyz grid** switching  
      especially when using different checkpoints  
  - update **second pass** options for clarity
  - models:
    - civitai download missing model previews
  - add **openvino** (experimental) cpu optimized model compile and inference  
    enable with `--use-openvino`  
    thanks @disty0  
  - enable batch **img2img** scale-by workflows  
    now you can batch process with rescaling based on each individual original image size  
  - fixes:
    - fix extra networks previews  
    - css fixes  
    - improved extensions compatibility (e.g. *sd-cn-animation*)  
    - allow changing **vae** on-the-fly for both original and diffusers backend

## Update for 2023-08-20

Another release thats been baking in dev branch for a while...

- general:
  - caching of extra network information to enable much faster create/refresh operations  
    thanks @midcoastal
- diffusers:
  - add **hires** support (*experimental*)  
    applies to all model types that support img2img, including **sd** and **sd-xl**  
    also supports all hires upscaler types as well as standard params like steps and denoising strength  
    when used with **sd-xl**, it can be used with or without refiner loaded  
    how to enable - there are no explicit checkboxes other than second pass itself:
    - hires: upscaler is set and target resolution is not at default  
    - refiner: if refiner model is loaded  
  - images save options: *before hires*, *before refiner*
  - redo `move model to cpu` logic in settings -> diffusers to be more reliable  
    note that system defaults have also changed, so you may need to tweak to your liking  
  - update dependencies

## Update for 2023-08-17

Smaller update, but with some breaking changes (to prepare for future larger functionality)...

- general:
  - update all metadata saved with images  
    see <https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/wiki/Metadata> for details  
  - improved **amd** installer with support for **navi 2x & 3x** and **rocm 5.4/5.5/5.6**  
    thanks @evshiron  
  - fix **img2img** resizing (applies to *original, diffusers, hires*)  
  - config change: main `config.json` no longer contains entire configuration  
    but only differences from defaults (similar to recent change performed to `ui-config.json`)  
- diffusers:
  - enable **batch img2img** workflows  
- original:  
  - new samplers: **dpm++ 3M sde** (standard and karras variations)  
    enable in *settings -> samplers -> show samplers*
  - expose always/never discard penultimate sigma  
    enable in *settings -> samplers*  

## Update for 2023-08-11

This is a big one thats been cooking in `dev` for a while now, but finally ready for release...

- diffusers:
  - **pipeline autodetect**
    if pipeline is set to autodetect (default for new installs), app will try to autodetect pipeline based on selected model  
    this should reduce user errors such as loading **sd-xl** model when **sd** pipeline is selected  
  - **quick vae decode** as alternative to full vae decode which is very resource intensive  
    quick decode is based on `taesd` and produces lower quality, but its great for tests or grids as it runs much faster and uses far less vram  
    disabled by default, selectable in *txt2img/img2img -> advanced -> full quality*  
  - **prompt attention** for sd and sd-xl  
    supports both `full parser` and native `compel`  
    thanks @ai-casanova  
  - advanced **lora load/apply** methods  
    in addition to standard lora loading that was recently added to sd-xl using diffusers, now we have  
    - **sequential apply** (load & apply multiple loras in sequential manner) and  
    - **merge and apply** (load multiple loras and merge before applying to model)  
    see *settings -> diffusers -> lora methods*  
    thanks @hameerabbasi and @ai-casanova  
  - **sd-xl vae** from safetensors now applies correct config  
    result is that 3rd party vaes can be used without washed out colors  
  - options for optimized memory handling for lower memory usage  
    see *settings -> diffusers*
- general:
  - new **civitai model search and download**  
    native support for civitai, integrated into ui as *models -> civitai*  
  - updated requirements  
    this time its a bigger change so upgrade may take longer to install new requirements
  - improved **extra networks** performance with large number of networks

## Update for 2023-08-05

Another minor update, but it unlocks some cool new items...

- diffusers:
  - vaesd live preview (sd and sd-xl)  
  - fix inpainting (sd and sd-xl)  
- general:
  - new torch 2.0 with ipex (intel arc)  
  - additional callbacks for extensions  
    enables latest comfyui extension  

## Update for 2023-07-30

Smaller release, but IMO worth a post...

- diffusers:
  - sd-xl loras are now supported!
  - memory optimizations: Enhanced sequential CPU offloading, model CPU offload, FP16 VAE
    - significant impact if running SD-XL (for example, but applies to any model) with only 8GB VRAM
  - update packages
- minor bugfixes

## Update for 2023-07-26

This is a big one, new models, new diffusers, new features and updated UI...

First, **SD-XL 1.0** is released and yes, SD.Next supports it out of the box!

- [SD-XL Base](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0/blob/main/sd_xl_base_1.0.safetensors)
- [SD-XL Refiner](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-refiner-1.0/blob/main/sd_xl_refiner_1.0.safetensors)

Also fresh is new **Kandinsky 2.2** model that does look quite nice:

- [Kandinsky Decoder](https://huggingface.co/kandinsky-community/kandinsky-2-2-decoder)
- [Kandinsky Prior](https://huggingface.co/kandinsky-community/kandinsky-2-2-prior)

Actual changelog is:

- general:
  - new loading screens and artwork
  - major ui simplification for both txt2img and img2img  
    nothing is removed, but you can show/hide individual sections  
    default is very simple interface, but you can enable any sections and save it as default in settings  
  - themes: add additional built-in theme, `amethyst-nightfall`
  - extra networks: add add/remove tags to prompt (e.g. lora activation keywords)
  - extensions: fix couple of compatibility items
  - firefox compatibility improvements
  - minor image viewer improvements
  - add backend and operation info to metadata

- diffusers:
  - were out of experimental phase and diffusers backend is considered stable  
  - sd-xl: support for **sd-xl 1.0** official model
  - sd-xl: loading vae now applies to both base and refiner and saves a bit of vram  
  - sd-xl: denoising_start/denoising_end
  - sd-xl: enable dual prompts  
    dual prompt is used if set regardless if refiner is enabled/loaded  
    if refiner is loaded & enabled, refiner prompt will also be used for refiner pass  
    - primary prompt goes to [OpenAI CLIP-ViT/L-14](https://huggingface.co/openai/clip-vit-large-patch14)
    - refiner prompt goes to [OpenCLIP-ViT/bigG-14](https://huggingface.co/laion/CLIP-ViT-bigG-14-laion2B-39B-b160k)
  - **kandinsky 2.2** support  
    note: kandinsky model must be downloaded using model downloader, not as safetensors due to specific model format  
  - refiner: fix batch processing
  - vae: enable loading of pure-safetensors vae files without config  
    also enable *automatic* selection to work with diffusers  
  - sd-xl: initial lora support  
    right now this applies to official lora released by **stability-ai**, support for **kohyas** lora is expected soon  
  - implement img2img and inpainting (experimental)  
    actual support and quality depends on model  
    it works as expected for sd 1.5, but not so much for sd-xl for now  
  - implement limited stop/interrupt for diffusers
    works between stages, not within steps  
  - add option to save image before refiner pass  
  - option to set vae upcast in settings  
  - enable fp16 vae decode when using optimized vae  
    this pretty much doubles performance of decode step (delay after generate is done)  

- original
  - fix hires secondary sampler  
    this now fully obsoletes `fallback_sampler` and `force_hr_sampler_name`  


## Update for 2023-07-18

While were waiting for official SD-XL release, heres another update with some fixes and enhancements...

- **global**
  - image save: option to add invisible image watermark to all your generated images  
    disabled by default, can be enabled in settings -> image options  
    watermark information will be shown when loading image such as in process image tab  
    also additional cli utility `/cli/image-watermark.py` to read/write/strip watermarks from images  
  - batch processing: fix metadata saving, also allow to drag&drop images for batch processing  
  - ui configuration: you can modify all ui default values from settings as usual,  
    but only values that are non-default will be written to `ui-config.json`  
  - startup: add cmd flag to skip all `torch` checks  
  - startup: force requirements check on each server start  
    there are too many misbehaving extensions that change system requirements  
  - internal: safe handling of all config file read/write operations  
    this allows sdnext to run in fully shared environments and prevents any possible configuration corruptions  
- **diffusers**:
  - sd-xl: remove image watermarks autocreated by 0.9 model  
  - vae: enable loading of external vae, documented in diffusers wiki  
    and mix&match continues, you can even use sd-xl vae with sd 1.5 models!  
  - samplers: add concept of *default* sampler to avoid needing to tweak settings for primary or second pass  
    note that sampler details will be printed in log when running in debug level  
  - samplers: allow overriding of sampler beta values in settings  
  - refiner: fix refiner applying only to first image in batch  
  - refiner: allow using direct latents or processed output in refiner  
  - model: basic support for one more model: [UniDiffuser](https://github.com/thu-ml/unidiffuser)  
    download using model downloader: `thu-ml/unidiffuser-v1`  
    and set resolution to 512x512  

## Update for 2023-07-14

Trying to unify settings for both original and diffusers backend without introducing duplicates...

- renamed **hires fix** to **second pass**  
  as that is what it actually is, name hires fix is misleading to start with  
- actual **hires fix** and **refiner** are now options inside **second pass** section  
- obsoleted settings -> sampler -> **force_hr_sampler_name**  
  it is now part of **second pass** options and it works the same for both original and diffusers backend  
  which means you can use different scheduler settings for txt2img and hires if you want  
- sd-xl refiner will run if its loaded and if second pass is enabled  
  so you can quickly enable/disable refiner by simply enabling/disabling second pass  
- you can mix&match **model** and **refiner**  
  for example, you can generate image using sd 1.5 and still use sd-xl refiner as second pass  
- reorganized settings -> samplers to show which section refers to which backend  
- added diffusers **lmsd** sampler  

## Update for 2023-07-13

Another big one, but now improvements to both **diffusers** and **original** backends as well plus ability to dynamically switch between them!

- swich backend between diffusers and original on-the-fly
  - you can still use `--backend <backend>` and now that only means in which mode app will start,
    but you can change it anytime in ui settings
  - for example, you can even do things like generate image using sd-xl,  
    then switch to original backend and perform inpaint using a different model  
- diffusers backend:
  - separate ui settings for refiner pass with sd-xl  
    you can specify: prompt, negative prompt, steps, denoise start  
  - fix loading from pure safetensors files  
    now you can load sd-xl from safetensors file or from huggingface folder format  
  - fix kandinsky model (2.1 working, 2.2 was just released and will be soon)  
- original backend:
  - improvements to vae/unet handling as well as cross-optimization heads  
    in non-technical terms, this means lower memory usage and higher performance  
    and you should be able to generate higher resolution images without any other changes
- other:
  - major refactoring of the javascript code  
    includes fixes for text selections and navigation  
  - system info tab now reports on nvidia driver version as well  
  - minor fixes in extra-networks  
  - installer handles origin changes for submodules  

big thanks to @huggingface team for great communication, support and fixing all the reported issues asap!


## Update for 2023-07-10

Service release with some fixes and enhancements:

- diffusers:
  - option to move base and/or refiner model to cpu to free up vram  
  - model downloader options to specify model variant / revision / mirror  
  - now you can download `fp16` variant directly for reduced memory footprint  
  - basic **img2img** workflow (*sketch* and *inpaint* are not supported yet)  
    note that **sd-xl** img2img workflows are architecturaly different so it will take longer to implement  
  - updated hints for settings  
- extra networks:
  - fix corrupt display on refesh when new extra network type found  
  - additional ui tweaks  
  - generate thumbnails from previews only if preview resolution is above 1k
- image viewer:
  - fixes for non-chromium browsers and mobile users and add option to download image  
  - option to download image directly from image viewer
- general
  - fix startup issue with incorrect config  
  - installer should always check requirements on upgrades

## Update for 2023-07-08

This is a massive update which has been baking in a `dev` branch for a while now

- merge experimental diffusers support  

*TL;DR*: Yes, you can run **SD-XL** model in **SD.Next** now  
For details, see Wiki page: [Diffusers](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/wiki/Diffusers)  
Note this is still experimental, so please follow Wiki  
Additional enhancements and fixes will be provided over the next few days  
*Thanks to @huggingface team for making this possible and our internal @team for all the early testing*

Release also contains number of smaller updates:

- add pan & zoom controls (touch and mouse) to image viewer (lightbox)  
- cache extra networks between tabs  
  this should result in neat 2x speedup on building extra networks  
- add settings -> extra networks -> do not automatically build extra network pages  
  speeds up app start if you have a lot of extra networks and you want to build them manually when needed  
- extra network ui tweaks  

## Update for 2023-07-01

Small quality-of-life updates and bugfixes:

- add option to disallow usage of ckpt checkpoints
- change lora and lyco dir without server restart
- additional filename template fields: `uuid`, `seq`, `image_hash`  
- image toolbar is now shown only when image is present
- image `Zip` button gone and its not optional setting that applies to standard `Save` button
- folder `Show` button is present only when working on localhost,  
  otherwise its replaced with `Copy` that places image URLs on clipboard so they can be used in other apps

## Update for 2023-06-30

A bit bigger update this time, but contained to specific areas...

- change in behavior  
  extensions no longer auto-update on startup  
  using `--upgrade` flag upgrades core app as well as all submodules and extensions  
- **live server log monitoring** in ui  
  configurable via settings -> live preview  
- new **extra networks interface**  
  *note: if youre using a 3rd party ui extension for extra networks, it will likely need to be updated to work with new interface*
  - display in front of main ui, inline with main ui or as a sidebar  
  - lazy load thumbnails  
    drastically reduces load times for large number of extra networks  
  - auto-create thumbnails from preview images in extra networks in a background thread  
    significant load time saving on subsequent restarts  
  - support for info files in addition to description files  
  - support for variable aspect-ratio thumbnails  
  - new folder view  
- **extensions sort** by trending  
- add requirements check for training  

## Update for 2023-06-26

- new training tab interface  
  - redesigned preprocess, train embedding, train hypernetwork  
- new models tab interface  
  - new model convert functionality, thanks @akegarasu  
  - new model verify functionality  
- lot of ipex specific fixes/optimizations, thanks @disty0  

## Update for 2023-06-20

This one is less relevant for standard users, but pretty major if youre running an actual server  
But even if not, it still includes bunch of cumulative fixes since last release - and going by number of new issues, this is probably the most stable release so far...
(next one is not going to be as stable, but it will be fun :) )

- minor improvements to extra networks ui  
- more hints/tooltips integrated into ui  
- new dedicated api server  
  - but highly promising for high throughput server  
- improve server logging and monitoring with  
  - server log file rotation  
  - ring buffer with api endpoint `/sdapi/v1/log`  
  - real-time status and load endpoint `/sdapi/v1/system-info/status`

## Update for 2023-06-14

Second stage of a jumbo merge from upstream plus few minor changes...

- simplify token merging  
- reorganize some settings  
- all updates from upstream: **A1111** v1.3.2 [df004be] *(latest release)*  
  pretty much nothing major that i havent released in previous versions, but its still a long list of tiny changes  
  - skipped/did-not-port:  
    add separate hires prompt: unnecessarily complicated and spread over large number of commits due to many regressions  
    allow external scripts to add cross-optimization methods: dangerous and i dont see a use case for it so far  
    load extension info in threads: unnecessary as other optimizations ive already put place perform equally good  
  - broken/reverted:  
    sub-quadratic optimization changes  

## Update for 2023-06-13

Just a day later and one *bigger update*...
Both some **new functionality** as well as **massive merges** from upstream  

- new cache for models/lora/lyco metadata: `metadata.json`  
  drastically reduces disk access on app startup  
- allow saving/resetting of **ui default values**  
  settings -> ui defaults
- ability to run server without loaded model  
  default is to auto-load model on startup, can be changed in settings -> stable diffusion  
  if disabled, model will be loaded on first request, e.g. when you click generate  
  useful when you want to start server to perform other tasks like upscaling which do not rely on model  
- updated `accelerate` and `xformers`
- huge nubmer of changes ported from **A1111** upstream  
  this was a massive merge, hopefully this does not cause any regressions  
  and still a bit more pending...

## Update for 2023-06-12

- updated ui labels and hints to improve clarity and provide some extra info  
  this is 1st stage of the process, more to come...  
  if you want to join the effort, see <https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/discussions/1246>
- new localization and hints engine  
  how hints are displayed can be selected in settings -> ui  
- reworked **installer** sequence  
  as some extensions are loading packages directly from their preload sequence  
  which was preventing some optimizations to take effect  
- updated **settings** tab functionality, thanks @gegell  
  with real-time monitor for all new and/or updated settings  
- **launcher** will now warn if application owned files are modified  
  you are free to add any user files, but do not modify app files unless youre sure in what youre doing  
- add more profiling for scripts/extensions so you can see what takes time  
  this applies both to initial load as well as execution  
- experimental `sd_model_dict` setting which allows you to load model dictionary  
  from one model and apply weights from another model specified in `sd_model_checkpoint`  
  results? who am i to judge :)


## Update for 2023-06-05

Few new features and extra handling for broken extensions  
that caused my phone to go crazy with notifications over the weekend...

- added extra networks to **xyz grid** options  
  now you can have more fun with all your embeddings and loras :)  
- new **vae decode** method to help with larger batch sizes, thanks @bigdog  
- new setting -> lora -> **use lycoris to handle all lora types**  
  this is still experimental, but the goal is to obsolete old built-in lora module  
  as it doesnt understand many new loras and built-in lyco module can handle it all  
- somewhat optimize browser page loading  
  still slower than id want, but gradio is pretty bad at this  
- profiling of scripts/extensions callbacks  
  you can now see how much or pre/post processing is done, not just how long generate takes  
- additional exception handling so bad exception does not crash main app  
- additional background removal models  
- some work on bfloat16 which nobody really should be using, but why not 🙂


## Update for 2023-06-02

Some quality-of-life improvements while working on larger stuff in the background...

- redesign action box to be uniform across all themes  
- add **pause** option next to stop/skip  
- redesigned progress bar  
- add new built-in extension: **agent-scheduler**  
  very elegant way to getting full queueing capabilities, thank @artventurdev  
- enable more image formats  
  note: not all are understood by browser so previews and images may appear as blank  
  unless you have some browser extensions that can handle them  
  but they are saved correctly. and cant beat raw quality of 32-bit `tiff` or `psd` :)  
- change in behavior: `xformers` will be uninstalled on startup if they are not active  
  if you do have `xformers` selected as your desired cross-optimization method, then they will be used  
  reason is that a lot of libaries try to blindly import xformers even if they are not selected or not functional  

## Update for 2023-05-30

Another bigger one...And more to come in the next few days...

- new live preview mode: taesd  
  i really like this one, so its enabled as default for new installs  
- settings search feature  
- new sampler: dpm++ 2m sde  
- fully common save/zip/delete (new) options in all tabs  
  which (again) meant rework of process image tab  
- system info tab: live gpu utilization/memory graphs for nvidia gpus  
- updated controlnet interface  
- minor style changes  
- updated lora, swinir, scunet and ldsr code from upstream  
- start of merge from a1111 v1.3  

## Update for 2023-05-26

Some quality-of-life improvements...

- updated [README](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/blob/master/README.md)
- created [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)  
  this will be the source for all info about new things moving forward  
  and cross-posted to [Discussions#99](https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/discussions/99) as well as discord [announcements](https://discord.com/channels/1101998836328697867/1109953953396957286)
- optimize model loading on startup  
  this should reduce startup time significantly  
- set default cross-optimization method for each platform backend  
  applicable for new installs only  
  - `cuda` => Scaled-Dot-Product
  - `rocm` => Sub-quadratic
  - `directml` => Sub-quadratic
  - `ipex` => invokeais
  - `mps` => Doggettxs
  - `cpu` => Doggettxs
- optimize logging  
- optimize profiling  
  now includes startup profiling as well as `cuda` profiling during generate  
- minor lightbox improvements  
- bugfixes...i dont recall when was a release with at least several of those  

other than that - first stage of [Diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers) integration is now in master branch  
i dont recommend anyone to try it (and dont even think reporting issues for it)  
but if anyone wants to contribute, take a look at [project page](https://github.com/users/vladmandic/projects/1/views/1)

## Update for 2023-05-23

Major internal work with perhaps not that much user-facing to show for it ;)

- update core repos: **stability-ai**, **taming-transformers**, **k-diffusion, blip**, **codeformer**  
  note: to avoid disruptions, this is applicable for new installs only
- tested with **torch 2.1**, **cuda 12.1**, **cudnn 8.9**  
  (production remains on torch2.0.1+cuda11.8+cudnn8.8)  
- fully extend support of `--data-dir`  
  allows multiple installations to share pretty much everything, not just models  
  especially useful if you want to run in a stateless container or cloud instance  
- redo api authentication  
  now api authentication will use same user/pwd (if specified) for ui and strictly enforce it using httpbasicauth  
  new authentication is also fully supported in combination with ssl for both sync and async calls  
  if you want to use api programatically, see examples in `cli/sdapi.py`  
- add dark/light theme mode toggle  
- redo some `clip-skip` functionality  
- better matching for vae vs model  
- update to `xyz grid` to allow creation of large number of images without creating grid itself  
- update `gradio` (again)  
- more prompt parser optimizations  
- better error handling when importing image settings which are not compatible with current install  
  for example, when upscaler or sampler originally used is not available  
- fixes...amazing how many issues were introduced by porting a1111 v1.20 code without adding almost no new functionality  
  next one is v1.30 (still in dev) which does bring a lot of new features  

## Update for 2023-05-17

This is a massive one due to huge number of changes,  
but hopefully it will go ok...

- new **prompt parsers**  
  select in UI -> Settings -> Stable Diffusion  
  - **Full**: my new implementation  
  - **A1111**: for backward compatibility  
  - **Compel**: as used in ComfyUI and InvokeAI (a.k.a *Temporal Weighting*)  
  - **Fixed**: for really old backward compatibility  
- monitor **extensions** install/startup and  
  log if they modify any packages/requirements  
  this is a *deep-experimental* python hack, but i think its worth it as extensions modifying requirements  
  is one of most common causes of issues
- added `--safe` command line flag mode which skips loading user extensions  
  please try to use it before opening new issue  
- reintroduce `--api-only` mode to start server without ui  
- port *all* upstream changes from [A1111](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui)  
  up to today - commit hash `89f9faa`  

## Update for 2023-05-15

- major work on **prompt parsing**
  this can cause some differences in results compared to what youre used to, but its all about fixes & improvements
  - prompt parser was adding commas and spaces as separate words and tokens and/or prefixes
  - negative prompt weight using `[word:weight]` was ignored, it was always `0.909`
  - bracket matching was anything but correct. complex nested attention brackets are now working.
  - btw, if you run with `--debug` flag, youll now actually see parsed prompt & schedule
- updated all scripts in `/cli`  
- add option in settings to force different **latent sampler** instead of using primary only
- add **interrupt/skip** capabilities to process images

## Update for 2023-05-13

This is mostly about optimizations...

- improved `torch-directml` support  
  especially interesting for **amd** users on **windows**  where **torch+rocm** is not yet available  
  dont forget to run using `--use-directml` or default is **cpu**  
- improved compatibility with **nvidia** rtx 1xxx/2xxx series gpus  
- fully working `torch.compile` with **torch 2.0.1**  
  using `inductor` compile takes a while on first run, but does result in 5-10% performance increase  
- improved memory handling  
  for highest performance, you can also disable aggressive **gc** in settings  
- improved performance  
  especially *after* generate as image handling has been moved to separate thread  
- allow per-extension updates in extension manager  
- option to reset configuration in settings  

## Update for 2023-05-11

- brand new **extension manager**  
  this is pretty much a complete rewrite, so new issues are possible
- support for `torch` 2.0.1  
  note that if you are experiencing frequent hangs, this may be a worth a try  
- updated `gradio` to 3.29.0
- added `--reinstall` flag to force reinstall of all packages  
- auto-recover & re-attempt when `--upgrade` is requested but fails
- check for duplicate extensions  

## Update for 2023-05-08

Back online with few updates:

- bugfixes. yup, quite a lot of those  
- auto-detect some cpu/gpu capabilities on startup  
  this should reduce need to tweak and tune settings like no-half, no-half-vae, fp16 vs fp32, etc  
- configurable order of top level tabs  
- configurable order of scripts in txt2img and img2img  
  for both, see sections in ui-> settings -> user interface

## Update for 2023-05-04

Again, few days later...

- reviewed/ported **all** commits from **A1111** upstream  
  some a few are not applicable as i already have alternative implementations  
  and very few i choose not to implement (save/restore last-known-good-config is a bad hack)  
  otherwise, were fully up to date (it doesnt show on fork status as code merges were mostly manual due to conflicts)  
  but...due to sheer size of the updates, this may introduce some temporary issues  
- redesigned server restart function  
  now available and working in ui  
  actually, since server restart is now a true restart and not ui restart, it can be used much more flexibly  
- faster model load  
  plus support for slower devices via stream-load function (in ui settings)  
- better logging  
  this includes new `--debug` flag for more verbose logging when troubleshooting  

## Update for 2023-05-01

Been a bit quieter for last few days as changes were quite significant, but finally here we are...

- Updated core libraries: Gradio, Diffusers, Transformers
- Added support for **Intel ARC** GPUs via Intel OneAPI IPEX (auto-detected)
- Added support for **TorchML** (set by default when running on non-compatible GPU or on CPU)
- Enhanced support for AMD GPUs with **ROCm**
- Enhanced support for Apple **M1/M2**
- Redesigned command params: run `webui --help` for details
- Redesigned API and script processing
- Experimental support for multiple **Torch compile** options
- Improved sampler support
- Google Colab: <https://colab.research.google.com/drive/126cDNwHfifCyUpCCQF9IHpEdiXRfHrLN>  
  Maintained by <https://github.com/Linaqruf/sd-notebook-collection>
- Fixes, fixes, fixes...

To take advantage of new out-of-the-box tunings, its recommended to delete your `config.json` so new defaults are applied. its not necessary, but otherwise you may need to play with UI Settings to get the best of Intel ARC, TorchML, ROCm or Apple M1/M2.

## Update for 2023-04-27

a bit shorter list as:

- ive been busy with bugfixing  
  there are a lot of them, not going to list each here.  
  but seems like critical issues backlog is quieting down and soon i can focus on new features development.

- add option to specify fallback sampler if primary sampler is not compatible with desired operation  
- make clip skip a local parameter  
- remove obsolete items from UI settings  
- set defaults for AMD ROCm  
  if you have issues, you may want to start with a fresh install so configuration can be created from scratch
- set defaults for Apple M1/M2  
  if you have issues, you may want to start with a fresh install so configuration can be created from scratch

  works for text and image generation, but not for process as there is no progress bar reported there to start with  
- force unload `xformers` when not used  
  improves compatibility with AMD/M1 platforms  
- add `styles.csv` to UI settings to allow customizing path  
- add `--skip-git` to cmd flags for power users that want

This has been pending for a while, but finally uploaded some massive changes

- New launcher
  - `webui.bat` and `webui.sh`:  
    Platform specific wrapper scripts that starts `launch.py` in Python virtual environment  
    *Note*: Server can run without virtual environment, but it is recommended to use it  
    This is carry-over from original repo  
    **If youre unsure which launcher to use, this is the one you want**  
  - `launch.py`:  
    Main startup script  
    Can be used directly to start server in manually activated `venv` or to run it without `venv`  
  - `installer.py`:  
    Main installer, used by `launch.py`  
  - `webui.py`:  
    Main server script  
- New logger
- New exception handler
- Built-in performance profiler
- New requirements handling
- Move of most of command line flags into UI Settings
